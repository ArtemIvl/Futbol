Futbol Statistics website

The goal of the website is to provide detailed football team and match information. Enhance the experience of football fans and analysts by providing easy access to team and match data.

To run the app simply clone a repository and run app.py.

This project was created specifically for Digital Thinking course at LIUC University in Italy, Castellanza by Artemii Ivliev and YiÄŸit Aslan, spring semester 2024.
